## Introduction

Imagine a world where MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, and Rookies of the Year are awarded based on undeniable performance data, free from bias and human error. In the quest for excellence, why leave awards to the subjective judgments of a jury when the unerring eye of advanced statistical metrics can crown the best with precision?

This project analyzes the jury's award decisions against statistical data to identify discrepancies and highlight the most underrated players of this era, aiming for a clearer and fairer assessment of player excellence.

## Data Sources
The analysis leverages three NBA datasets provided by Paradime under the *NBA_HISTORICAL.PUBLIC* schema:
- *GAMES*
- *PLAYER_GAME_LOGS*
- *COMMON_PLAYER_INFO*

Additionally, a dataset with NBA player awards was curated using the NBA API and loaded to the next Snowflace instance *IKERCAMARAVKVCU_ANALYTICS.ADDITIONAL_DATA.PLAYER_AWARDS*.

## Methodology
### Tools Used
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbtâ„¢.
- **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** for data storage and computing.
- **[Sigma Computing](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/)** for data visualization.

### Applied Techniques
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ into seasonal player statistics
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_player_game_logs_ and _stg_common_player_info_ to understand
  playoff and regular season performance by individual players
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_common_player_info_ for insights on NBA players' college backgrounds.
- SQL and dbtâ„¢ to transform _stg_team_stats_by_season_ for insights on NBA Teams' historical playoff performance.

*Insights:* 
Kentucky has produced the most NBA players in NBA history by a significant margin.... Go Wildcats! Also, this data is [slightly inaccurate](https://erudera.com/resources/colleges-with-most-nba-players/), but that's the NBA API's fault, not mine ðŸ¤£
